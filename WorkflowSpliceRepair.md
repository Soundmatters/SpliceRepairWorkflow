# Workflow for replacing failed splices on audio tape. 

## Overview. 
The following is a workflow for repairing failed splices on audio tape.  


The splicing tape used in this workflow is archival-grade.  The solvent used is Ethyl alchohol.  Ethyl alchohol, or any alternate solvent, should be spot-checked on an unrecorded section of the audio tape being treated before proceeding.

4) Place the cleaned audio tape in a splicing block.  Join the two pieces of audio tape and apply splicing tape, a 3/8 to 1/2-inch pice of splicing tape is usualy sufficient.
