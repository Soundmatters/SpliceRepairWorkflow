# Workflow for replacing failed splices on audio tape. 

## Overview. 
The following is a workflow for repairing failed splices on audio tape.  

Tools and supplies:

>archival-quality splicing tape  
>splicing block  
>swabs  
>solvent (ethyl alchohol)  



Note: Ethyl alchohol, or any alternate solvent, should be spot-checked on an unrecorded section of the audio tape being treated before proceeding. Test should confirm that the solvent will not alter its back-coat, base or emulsion layer.

## Workflow. 
1) Carefully remove the backing of the failed splicing tape.

2) Using only the tip of a swab, apply solvent and loosen the failed adhesive on the audio tape backing.

3) Using only the side of the swab, in an upward rolling motion, lift the disolved adhesive off the audio tape.  Repeat steps 2 and 3, as needed.

4) Place the cleaned audio tape in a splicing block.  Join the two pieces of audio tape and apply splicing tape; a 3/8 to 1/2-inch piece of splicing tape is usualy sufficient.
